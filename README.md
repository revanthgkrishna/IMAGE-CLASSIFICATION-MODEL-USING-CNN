Description:

This task requires building a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify images into different categories using TensorFlow or PyTorch. CNNs are widely used in image recognition tasks due to their efficiency in handling spatial hierarchies.
Steps Involved:
1. Select an image dataset (e.g., CIFAR-10, MNIST, or custom dataset).
2. Preprocess and normalize the image data.
3. Define a CNN architecture with convolutional, pooling, and dense layers.
4. Train the model on the dataset.
5. Evaluate model accuracy and loss.
6. Visualize training progress with accuracy/loss graphs.
